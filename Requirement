Certainly! Here are some examples of non-functional requirements for business process management to handle errors in a business process:

1. Reliability: The business process management system should be highly reliable, minimizing the occurrence of errors and ensuring smooth operation of the processes.

2. Error Handling: The system should have robust error handling mechanisms in place to detect, capture, and handle errors that occur during the execution of business processes.

3. Fault Tolerance: The system should be resilient to failures and able to recover gracefully from errors without disrupting the overall business process flow.

4. Scalability: The business process management system should be capable of handling a growing number of transactions and errors without compromising performance or stability.

5. Auditability: The system should provide detailed logging and auditing capabilities, allowing for easy identification and analysis of errors. This helps in troubleshooting and process improvement.

6. Notification and Alerting: The system should be able to generate timely notifications and alerts when errors occur, enabling relevant stakeholders to take corrective actions promptly.

7. Performance: The system should be optimized for efficient error handling, ensuring that error resolution does not significantly impact the overall performance of the business processes.

8. Security: The business process management system should ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of error-related data and protect against unauthorized access or tampering.

9. User-Friendly Interfaces: The system should provide intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for error monitoring, investigation, and resolution, facilitating quick and effective error handling.

10. Compliance: The business process management system should adhere to relevant regulatory and compliance requirements in handling errors, ensuring data privacy and security.

Remember, these requirements should be tailored to the specific needs and context of your business process management implementation.
