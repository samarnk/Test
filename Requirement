Certainly! Here are non-functional requirements for business process management to handle errors in the claim process flow:

1. Error Logging and Tracking: The system should have a robust error logging mechanism that captures and tracks all errors that occur during the claim process. This ensures that errors are properly recorded and can be easily referenced for investigation and resolution.

2. Error Notifications: The system should generate notifications or alerts to relevant stakeholders when errors occur in the claim process. This ensures that responsible parties are promptly informed about the errors and can take appropriate actions to address them.

3. Error Handling and Recovery: The business process management system should have built-in mechanisms to handle errors encountered during the claim process. It should be able to recover from errors gracefully, allowing the process to resume or follow an alternative path without losing the case or its visibility in the user task list.

4. Error Escalation: In cases where errors cannot be resolved automatically or by the responsible parties, the system should have an escalation process in place. This ensures that critical errors are escalated to higher-level support or management for timely resolution.

5. Error Reporting and Analysis: The system should provide comprehensive error reporting capabilities, allowing stakeholders to analyze the types, frequencies, and patterns of errors occurring in the claim process. This information can be used to identify root causes, improve the process, and implement preventive measures.

6. Data Integrity and Recovery: The business process management system should ensure the integrity and availability of claim-related data, even in the event of an error. It should have mechanisms in place to protect and recover data, preventing loss or corruption during error handling and recovery processes.

7. System Availability: The system should be highly available, minimizing downtime and ensuring uninterrupted access to the claim process and related tasks. This ensures that errors can be addressed promptly and does not impact the overall efficiency of the claim process.

8. Scalability: The business process management system should be capable of handling a growing number of claims and errors without compromising performance or stability. It should scale effectively to accommodate increased load and maintain error handling efficiency.

9. User-Friendly Error Management: The system should provide user-friendly interfaces and tools for error management, allowing users to easily identify, investigate, and resolve errors. This includes features such as error dashboards, intuitive error codes/messages, and guided error resolution workflows.

10. Compliance and Auditability: The system should comply with relevant regulatory requirements and provide auditing capabilities for error handling. This ensures that error-related activities are recorded, traceable, and compliant with applicable regulations.

These non-functional requirements should be communicated clearly to the vendor during the implementation process to ensure that the business process management solution adequately addresses error handling needs.
