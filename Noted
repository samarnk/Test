Previously, the FileNet Listener would only call the "send_file_metadata" API when new documents were uploaded to FileNet. 
However, there are scenarios where attributes need to be changed to correct metadata due to indexing errors or document deletions from FileNet. Therefore, we have added an "event" field to identify the event that triggers the "send_file_metadata" API call.
